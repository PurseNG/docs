# Introduction

Welcome to our simple-to-use REST APIs, accepting payments in your applications with Purse is a only a request or two away. To get started, grab yourself a [free merchant account](https://purse.ng/register) you can test the endpoints against. Once you are logged into your account, you would have access to a test key so you can start making API requests with no further ado.

The sample requests shown here are made with [cURL](http://curl.haxx.se/) but you can make use of any HTTP client to test our endpoints. An easy pick to quickly start making API calls would be [POSTMAN](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/postman-rest-client/fdmmgilgnpjigdojojpjoooidkmcomcm/), an awesome Chrome extension we love to use ourselves.

Both request body data and response data are formatted as JSON. Content type for responses will always be application/json.

# Authentication

To get authenticated on Purse, please include your API key in the Authorization header of every request you make to our endpoints.

> All you need to do is format your request header like:

```shell
# With shell, you can just pass the correct header with each request
curl "api_endpoint_here"
  -H "Authorization: Purse g4Cbu09M75w1kEYIKHRmXaRCINxglbR1uWkXyg1X"
```

> Make sure to replace `g4Cbu09M75w1kEYIKHRmXaRCINxglbR1uWkXyg1X` with your API key.

`Authorization: Purse g4Cbu09M75w1kEYIKHRmXaRCINxglbR1uWkXyg1X`

<aside class="notice">
You must replace <code>g4Cbu09M75w1kEYIKHRmXaRCINxglbR1uWkXyg1X</code> with your personal API key.
